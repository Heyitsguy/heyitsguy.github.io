## **Create Your Own Personal Blog With Jekyll**
---
Programming is a journey and developers are constantly learning as new technologies are coming out. One of the most popular ways to learn a new technology is through user and community driven content whether it be blogs, youtube, or tutorial sites. It is important for developers to start contributing to or producing informative content early on into their development career so that they can document their own journey and help others who are less knowledgeable on a specific topic out. 
    
   Most beginners might want to write a blog but do not have the technical abilities to create a blog website yet. Blogging sites like medium help beginners lower the barrier to entry and let them write blogs without worrying about the technical aspect of publishing their content. However, blogging sites like medium compromises on customizability for convenience. In this blog I am going to show you a very quick and easy way to set up your own blog from a template and host it for free on github pages. Even though you are using a template for your blog, Jekyll allows you full control over the template so that you can customize it to your heartâ€™s content.
